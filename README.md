# ðŸš• **Predicting Taxi Fares Using Deep Learning** ðŸ“Š

---

- The growth of urban transportation services, such as ride-hailing and taxi systems, has led to a significant increase in demand for accurate and transparent fare estimation. Taxi fare prediction plays a pivotal role in improving user trust, enhancing operational efficiency, and optimizing pricing strategies for service providers. 

- This project delves into the application of **deep learning regression** to predict taxi fares using a variety of influential features. By leveraging historical trip data and advanced neural network models, we aim to build a robust system that estimates fares based on parameters such as **distance traveled**, **traffic conditions**, **time of day**, and many more.

- Using the dataset sourced from [Kaggle's Taxi Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/taxi-price-prediction/data), this project will explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and state-of-the-art neural network architectures to achieve high prediction accuracy.
